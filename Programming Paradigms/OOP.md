## Introduction

### Definition and overview of Object-Oriented Programming

### Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and exposing a simple interface

### Encapsulation: Containing and protecting data and behavior within objects

### Inheritance: Reusing and extending code through class hierarchies

### Polymorphism: Handling different object types using a unified interface
