## Examples

Here is an example of how to use Cosmos DB with the .NET SDK. This example assumes that you have an Azure Cosmos DB account created and the connection string available. Replace "your_connection_string" and "your_database_id" with your own values.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

namespace CosmosDbExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Instantiate a new CosmosClient
            var cosmosClient = new CosmosClient("your_connection_string");

            // Create a new database
            var database = await cosmosClient.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync("your_database_id");

            // Create a new container
            var containerProperties = new ContainerProperties("Users", "/id");
            var container = await database.Database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(containerProperties);

            // Create a sample user
            var user = new { id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), name = "John Doe", age = 30 };

            // Add the user to the container
            var itemResponse = await container.Container.CreateItemAsync(user);
            Console.WriteLine($"User created with id: {user.id}");

            // Query the user from the container
            var queryDefinition = new QueryDefinition($"SELECT * FROM Users u WHERE u.name = 'John Doe'");
            var resultSetIterator = container.Container.GetItemQueryIterator<dynamic>(queryDefinition);

            Console.WriteLine("User(s) with the name 'John Doe':");
            while (resultSetIterator.HasMoreResults)
            {
                var queryResult = await resultSetIterator.ReadNextAsync();
                foreach (var result in queryResult)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"User: {result.id}, Name: {result.name}, Age: {result.age}");
                }
            }

            // Update the user's age
            user.age = 31;
            await container.Container.ReplaceItemAsync(user, user.id, new PartitionKey(user.id));
            Console.WriteLine("User's age updated");

            // Delete the user
            await container.Container.DeleteItemAsync<dynamic>(user.id, new PartitionKey(user.id));
            Console.WriteLine("User deleted");

            // Clean up resources
            await container.Container.DeleteContainerAsync();
            await database.Database.DeleteAsync();
            cosmosClient.Dispose();
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a Cosmos DB client, create a database and container, insert a user into the container, query for users with a specific name, update the user's age, delete the user, and finally clean up the created resources.

## Data Modeling

Cosmos DB is a schema-agnostic database, meaning that it does not enforce a specific schema on the data it stores. When creating data models for Cosmos DB, the most crucial aspect is selecting the right partition key. The partition key determines how data is distributed across physical partitions in the database. Ideally, a partition key should have high cardinality and even distribution of data to avoid hotspots and ensure a balanced workload. Denormalization is a common technique used in Cosmos DB to optimize read performance by duplicating data or storing precomputed results, reducing the need for joins.

## Querying

Cosmos DB supports SQL-like queries for its document data model. These queries can include filtering, projections, and aggregation operations. Cosmos DB also supports secondary indexing, which can help improve query performance when searching by non-partition key attributes. However, secondary indexes come with some performance costs during writes, so they should be used judiciously. Partitioning plays a vital role in scaling queries, as queries targeted at specific partitions are generally more performant than cross-partition queries.

## Multi-Model Data

Cosmos DB is designed as a multi-model database, which means it can store and manage different types of data, such as document, key-value, graph, and column-family data models. Cosmos DB uses a core data model called Atom Record Sequence (ARS) to enable this functionality. The ARS model allows Cosmos DB to store and manage data in different formats while maintaining a consistent query and programming model across all data types. This flexibility makes Cosmos DB suitable for various use cases and allows developers to choose the best data model for their application's requirements.

## Consistency Levels

One of the key features of Cosmos DB is its tunable consistency levels. Cosmos DB offers five consistency levels: strong, bounded staleness, session, consistent prefix, and eventual consistency. Strong consistency guarantees that reads always return the most recent committed version of an item. Bounded staleness provides a balance between strong and eventual consistency by allowing reads to return slightly stale data within a defined bound. Session consistency guarantees that reads are consistent within a session, which is suitable for scenarios where a user's actions should be immediately visible to them. Consistent prefix ensures that reads never see out-of-order writes. Finally, eventual consistency offers the lowest latency and highest availability but does not guarantee immediate consistency. Choosing the right consistency level depends on your application's requirements in terms of consistency, performance, and availability.

## Partitioning and Replication

Cosmos DB uses partitioning to distribute data across multiple physical partitions for horizontal scaling. Partitioning is based on the partition key you define during data modeling. Cosmos DB automatically manages partitions, creating new ones and rebalancing data as needed. Replication in Cosmos DB is designed for global distribution and high availability. You can configure multiple read and write regions for your Cosmos DB account, and data is automatically replicated across all regions. Cosmos DB provides active-active and active-passive replication models, and you can set up failover policies to handle region outages.

## Tuning and Optimization

To optimize Cosmos DB performance, it's essential to monitor key metrics such as request units (RUs), latency, and storage. Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB metrics can help you identify performance issues and bottlenecks. Optimizing indexing in Cosmos DB involves choosing the right indexing policy for your workload, including deciding between consistent and lazy indexing. You can also use composite indexes to improve query performance for specific queries. Optimizing read and write performance requires careful partition key selection, proper use of consistency levels, and efficient query design.

## Security

Cosmos DB offers various security features, such as authentication and authorization using primary and secondary keys or Azure Active Directory. Data is encrypted at rest using service-managed keys, and you can also use customer-managed keys for additional control. Cosmos DB supports encryption in transit using SSL/TLS. For network security, you can use Azure Virtual Networks, Service Endpoints, and Private Endpoints to restrict access to your Cosmos DB account.

## Integration

Cosmos DB provides SDKs for popular programming languages like .NET, Java, Node.js, and Python, making it easy to integrate into your application stack. It also offers a REST API and support for popular database APIs like MongoDB and Cassandra. Cosmos DB can be used in conjunction with other Azure services, such as Azure Functions for serverless computing and Azure Stream Analytics for real-time data processing and analytics.

## Backup and Recovery

Cosmos DB automatically takes periodic backups of your data, with a default retention period of 30 days. You can restore data from these backups using the Azure Portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI. In addition to the built-in backup mechanism, you can also perform custom backups using Change Feed or by exporting data to another storage service like Azure Blob Storage. Restoring data from custom backups requires you to write your own import logic or use available tools to import the data back into Cosmos DB.
