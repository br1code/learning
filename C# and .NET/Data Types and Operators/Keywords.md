# Keywords

- abstract: Indicates that a class or method is incomplete and must be implemented by a derived class or override.

- as: Performs a cast or conversion to a specific type, and returns null if the cast is not possible.

- base: Refers to the base class or the base class implementation of a method or property.

- bool: A data type that represents a boolean value of true or false.

- break: Terminates a loop or switch statement and continues execution after the loop or switch.

- byte: A data type that represents an 8-bit unsigned integer.

- case: Marks a section of code in a switch statement that should be executed if the value of the switch expression matches a specific case label.

- catch: Catches an exception and specifies a block of code to handle it.

- char: A data type that represents a single Unicode character.

- checked: Enables overflow checking for arithmetic operations that involve integral types.

- class: Defines a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects.

- const: Declares a constant value that cannot be changed.

- continue: Skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration.

- decimal: A data type that represents a decimal number with high precision.

- default: Specifies a default value for a switch statement or a default parameter value for a method.

- delegate: Defines a type that represents a method signature and can be used to create delegate instances that can invoke methods.

- do: Starts a do-while loop, which executes a block of code at least once and then continues while a specified condition is true.

- double: A data type that represents a double-precision floating-point number.

- else: Specifies a block of code to execute if a condition is false.

- enum: Defines an enumeration, which is a set of named constant values.

- event: Declares an event, which is a mechanism for allowing classes to communicate with each other.

- explicit: Defines an explicit conversion operator that converts an instance of one type to another type.

- extern: Specifies that a method is implemented outside the C# code, typically in a DLL or an external function.

- false: A boolean value that represents false.

- finally: Specifies a block of code that is executed after a try block, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.

- fixed: Creates a fixed-size buffer that allows unsafe code to access a block of memory without performing array bounds checks.

- float: A data type that represents a single-precision floating-point number.

- for: Starts a for loop, which repeats a block of code a specified number of times.

- foreach: Iterates over a collection of elements, such as an array or a list.

- goto: Transfers control to a labeled statement in a program, which can make code harder to read and maintain.

- if: Specifies a block of code to execute if a condition is true.

- implicit: Defines an implicit conversion operator that converts an instance of one type to another type without requiring an explicit cast.

- in: Specifies that a parameter should be passed by reference, but should not be modified by the method.

- int: A data type that represents a 32-bit signed integer.

- interface: Defines an interface, which is a contract that specifies a set of methods, properties, and events that a class must implement.

- internal: Specifies that a type or member is only accessible within the assembly that it is defined in.

- is: Returns a boolean value indicating whether an object is an instance of a certain type or not.

- lock: Used to acquire a mutual exclusion lock to prevent multiple threads from executing a specific code block simultaneously.

- long: A 64-bit signed integer data type.

- namespace: Used to define a scope that contains a set of related objects.

- new: Used to create a new instance of a class or struct.

- null: Used to represent a null reference.

- object: The ultimate base class for all C# objects.

- operator: Used to define operators for custom types.

- out: Used to pass arguments by reference.

- override: Used to indicate that a method in a derived class is intended to override a method with the same name in the base class.

- params: Used to specify a method parameter array.

- private: A keyword that specifies that a member is accessible only within the class or struct that contains it.

- protected: A keyword that specifies that a member is accessible within its class and any derived class.

- public: A keyword that specifies that a member is accessible from any code.

- readonly: A keyword that specifies that a field or variable can only be assigned a value at initialization or in a constructor.

- ref: A keyword used to pass arguments by reference.

- return: Used to exit a method and return a value to the calling code.

- sbyte: A signed 8-bit integer data type.

- sealed: A keyword used to prevent a class from being inherited.

- short: A 16-bit signed integer data type.

- sizeof: Used to return the size, in bytes, of a value type.

- stackalloc: Used to allocate memory on the stack.

- static: A keyword used to specify that a member is associated with the type itself, rather than with a specific instance of the type.

- string: A data type used to represent text.

- struct: A keyword used to define a value type.

- switch: Used to evaluate a set of conditions and execute the code associated with the first condition that is true.

- this: A keyword that refers to the current instance of a class or struct.

- throw: Used to throw an exception.

- true: A keyword that represents the Boolean value true.

- try: Used to specify a block of code to be executed, and to handle any exceptions that might occur.

- typeof: Used to obtain the System.Type object for a specified type.

- uint: An unsigned 32-bit integer data type.
