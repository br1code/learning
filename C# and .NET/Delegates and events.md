# Delegates and Events

## Simple Explanation

**Delegates** are essentially pointers to functions in C#. They allow you to create a reference to a function and pass that reference around your code, so that you can call that function from different parts of your code. 

**Events** are a way to notify subscribers when something happens, like a button click or a data update.

## Deep Explanation

### Delegates

In C#, delegates are types that define references to methods with a specific signature. They provide a way to reference a method and pass it around as a parameter, similar to a function pointer in C++.

A delegate is defined by specifying the method signature it represents, which includes the return type and the parameter types of the method. A delegate instance is created by assigning it a reference to a method with a matching signature. Once created, the delegate can be passed around like any other object, and can be invoked by calling the Invoke method on the delegate instance.

Delegates can also be used to create anonymous methods, which are inline methods that do not have a separate name or definition.

### Events

An event in C# is a mechanism for communication between objects in which an object can notify other objects when something happens. For example, a button click event can notify its subscribers (i.e., event handlers) that the button has been clicked.

Events are declared using the event keyword and have a delegate type that specifies the signature of the event handler method. An event can be subscribed to using the += operator, which adds an event handler to the invocation list of the event. When the event is raised, all event handlers in the invocation list are called in the order in which they were added.

It's important to note that events can only be raised by the class that declares them (i.e., the publisher), but can be subscribed to by any class (i.e., the subscriber). This provides a way to encapsulate the inner workings of a class while still allowing other classes to be notified of its events.

## Examples

### Delegates

```C#
// Define a delegate type
delegate int MyDelegate(string input);

// Define a method that matches the delegate signature
int MyMethod(string input)
{
    return input.Length;
}

// Create an instance of the delegate
MyDelegate del = new MyDelegate(MyMethod);

// Invoke the delegate
int result = del.Invoke("hello");
Console.WriteLine(result); // Output: 5
```

### Events

```C#
// Declare an event with a delegate type
public event EventHandler ButtonClicked;

// Subscribe to the event
ButtonClicked += MyEventHandler;

// Raise the event
ButtonClicked?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);

// Event handler method
void MyEventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Button clicked!");
}

```
