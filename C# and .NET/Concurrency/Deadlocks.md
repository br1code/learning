# Deadlocks

## Simple explanation

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked and waiting for each other to release resources that they need to proceed, resulting in a deadlock or a standstill. A deadlock can occur in any multi-threaded environment, including C# and .NET.

## Deep explanation

A deadlock happens when two or more threads are blocked and waiting for each other to release resources that they need to proceed. This happens when a thread holds a resource and waits for another thread to release a resource that it needs, while that thread holds a resource and waits for the first thread to release the resource it holds. In this scenario, neither thread can proceed, and the threads become deadlocked.

Deadlocks are a common problem in multi-threaded applications because of the inherent complexity of coordinating the access to shared resources. Deadlocks can be difficult to diagnose and fix because they may only occur under specific conditions and are often not easily reproducible.

To avoid deadlocks, it is important to ensure that threads acquire resources in a consistent order and release them in the reverse order. Additionally, it is important to limit the amount of time a thread holds a lock and to avoid holding multiple locks simultaneously.

## Examples

Let's say we have two threads, Thread 1 and Thread 2, and two resources, Resource A and Resource B.

Thread 1 acquires Resource A and then attempts to acquire Resource B, but Resource B is currently being held by Thread 2.

At the same time, Thread 2 has acquired Resource B and is attempting to acquire Resource A, which is being held by Thread 1.

Neither thread can proceed because they are waiting for the other thread to release the resource that they need, resulting in a deadlock.

Here's an example of a deadlock in C#:

```C#
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static object lock1 = new object();
    static object lock2 = new object();

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(DoWork1);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(DoWork2);
        t1.Start();
        t2.Start();
        t1.Join();
        t2.Join();
        Console.WriteLine("Done");
    }

    static void DoWork1()
    {
        lock (lock1)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Thread 1 acquired lock1");
            Thread.Sleep(100);
            lock (lock2)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Thread 1 acquired lock2");
            }
        }
    }

    static void DoWork2()
    {
        lock (lock2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Thread 2 acquired lock2");
            Thread.Sleep(100);
            lock (lock1)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Thread 2 acquired lock1");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we have two threads that both acquire two locks in different orders. Thread 1 acquires lock1 and then tries to acquire lock2, while Thread 2 acquires lock2 and then tries to acquire lock1. Because of the way the locks are acquired, a deadlock can occur if both threads run simultaneously.

When we run this code, we may see that it gets stuck and never finishes, indicating a deadlock has occurred. This happens because Thread 1 is holding lock1 and waiting for lock2, while Thread 2 is holding lock2 and waiting for lock1. Since neither thread can proceed until it acquires the lock it needs, they are both stuck, resulting in a deadlock.
