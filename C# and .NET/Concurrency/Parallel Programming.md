# Parallel programming

## Simple explanation

Parallel programming is a way of executing multiple tasks simultaneously on multiple processors. This can lead to faster and more efficient execution of code, especially in scenarios where a single task can be broken up into smaller, independent pieces that can be executed in parallel. In C# and .NET, you can use the Parallel class to perform parallel programming.

## Deep explanation

Parallel programming is a technique for leveraging multiple processors or cores to improve the performance of a program. Parallelism is achieved by breaking down a problem into smaller pieces that can be executed independently and simultaneously on different processors. The tasks are typically coordinated and synchronized so that they can work together to produce a final result. Parallel programming can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including numerical computation, data processing, and file I/O.

In C# and .NET, you can use the Parallel class to perform parallel programming. The Parallel class provides a simple and convenient way to execute a set of tasks in parallel. The class includes a variety of methods for parallelizing operations, including Parallel.ForEach, which allows you to iterate over a collection in parallel, and Parallel.Invoke, which allows you to execute a set of tasks in parallel. The Parallel class also includes a variety of options for controlling the degree of parallelism and managing synchronization between threads.

## Examples

Here's a basic example that demonstrates how to use Parallel.ForEach to process a collection in parallel:

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<int> numbers = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

        Parallel.ForEach(numbers, (number) =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Processed {number} on thread {Task.CurrentId}");
        });
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a list of integers and use Parallel.ForEach to process the numbers in parallel. The lambda expression passed to Parallel.ForEach is executed for each item in the collection, and the output shows that the processing is done on multiple threads.
