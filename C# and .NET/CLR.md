# CLR

CLR (Common Language Runtime) is the runtime environment of the .NET Framework that is responsible for compiling, interpreting, and executing .NET code.

When a .NET program is compiled, the compiler produces an executable file that contains the Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) code. This MSIL code is hardware-independent and can be executed on any platform that is compatible with .NET. 

In addition, the CLR also provides services such as:

- The garbage collector (GC): Is responsible for freeing the memory used by objects that are no longer in use, which simplifies the programmer's job in manual memory management.
  
- Exception handling: Allows the programmer to handle the errors and exceptions that may occur during program execution.

- Code security: Ensures that the code runs in a secure and controlled environment.

In summary, CLR is a key part of the .NET Framework and is responsible for ensuring that .NET programs run efficiently, safely, and reliably on any platform that is compatible with .NET.
