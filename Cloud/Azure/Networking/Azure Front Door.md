# Azure Front Door

Azure Front Door is a globally distributed, scalable, and secure application delivery service that provides advanced traffic routing, load balancing, and web application firewall (WAF) capabilities. It's designed to improve the performance, security, and reliability of web applications by intelligently routing user traffic to the closest and most available backend services. Here's a comprehensive overview:

## Global Load Balancing and Acceleration

Azure Front Door uses Anycast Protocol and a global network of edge locations to distribute user traffic across multiple backend services based on their proximity, health, and load. This helps reduce latency, optimize resource utilization, and ensure high availability by automatically rerouting traffic in case of backend failures.

## URL-Based Routing

Front Door enables you to define custom routing rules based on URL paths, allowing you to distribute requests to different backend pools or services based on the content of the request. This is useful for routing requests to microservices or different application components.

## SSL Offloading and End-to-End Encryption

Azure Front Door supports SSL offloading, which means it can decrypt incoming SSL/TLS traffic, process the requests, and then forward the traffic to the backend services over HTTP or HTTPS. This offloads the encryption and decryption tasks from the backend services, improving their performance and simplifying certificate management. Front Door also supports end-to-end encryption for secure communication between the service and backend resources.

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Azure Front Door includes an integrated Web Application Firewall (WAF) that protects your applications from common web threats and vulnerabilities. WAF uses custom rules and managed rule sets based on the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Core Rule Set to detect and block malicious traffic, helping to secure your applications from attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## Custom Domains and SSL Certificates

Front Door allows you to use custom domain names and SSL certificates for your applications, ensuring a consistent and secure user experience. You can either bring your own SSL certificates or use Azure-managed certificates with automatic renewal.

## Session Affinity

Azure Front Door supports session affinity, which helps maintain user session state by directing all requests from the same user to the same backend resource. This is particularly useful for applications that require session persistence, such as e-commerce websites or web applications with personalized content.

## Health Probes and Monitoring

Front Door uses active health probes to continuously monitor the health and availability of your backend resources. These probes check the status of specific URLs, HTTP status codes, or response times to determine the health of the resources. You can also monitor the performance and health of your Front Door service using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.

## Integration with Azure Services

Azure Front Door can be combined with other Azure services like Azure Traffic Manager, Azure Application Gateway, or Azure CDN to build comprehensive traffic management and application delivery solutions. Additionally, Front Door can be used with Azure App Services, Azure Virtual Machines, or other cloud resources as backend services.

Understanding Azure Front Door will help you design and manage scalable, secure, and high-performing web applications in Azure. Make sure to explore the official Azure Front Door documentation and related resources to learn more and apply this knowledge in your projects.
