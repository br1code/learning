# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

**TODO:**

- Create a Kubernetes cluster
- Create a deployment

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed container orchestration service that simplifies Kubernetes deployment, scaling, and operations. It enables you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes on Azure. Here's a comprehensive overview:

## Definition

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that provides a reliable, secure, and scalable environment for deploying and managing containerized applications. AKS simplifies the process of setting up and maintaining a Kubernetes cluster, enabling developers to focus on writing application code.

## Kubernetes Fundamentals

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a consistent and flexible environment for deploying microservices and other containerized applications, with built-in features for load balancing, scaling, and self-healing.

## Nodes and Node Pools

In AKS, a node is a virtual machine (VM) that hosts containers. Nodes are grouped into node pools, which are sets of identical VMs that run container workloads. Each node pool is assigned a specific VM size and can be independently scaled up or down as needed.

## Control Plane and Worker Nodes

The Kubernetes control plane is the set of components that manage the overall state of the cluster. In AKS, the control plane is fully managed by Azure, including automatic updates, scaling, and monitoring. Worker nodes, on the other hand, are the VMs that run your container workloads.

## Networking

AKS supports two main networking models: Kubernetes (kubenet) and Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI). Kubenet is the default networking model and offers a simpler setup, while Azure CNI provides more advanced features and integration with Azure Virtual Networks (VNet).

## Load Balancing and Ingress

AKS supports Kubernetes-native load balancing with services of type LoadBalancer and Ingress controllers for advanced traffic routing. You can use Azure Load Balancer for Layer-4 load balancing or Azure Application Gateway for Layer-7 load balancing and SSL termination.

## Storage

AKS supports various storage options for persistent data, including Azure Disks, Azure Files, and Azure NetApp Files. You can use Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) to provision and manage storage resources for your applications.

## Autoscaling

AKS supports Kubernetes autoscaling features, such as the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), which scales your application based on CPU or custom metrics, and the Cluster Autoscaler, which automatically adjusts the number of nodes in your node pools based on demand.

## Security

AKS provides various security features, such as integration with Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization, network security groups (NSGs) for network isolation, and Azure Private Link for private access to the control plane. Additionally, you can use Azure Policy to enforce compliance and security best practices.

## Monitoring and Logging

AKS integrates with Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics for monitoring and logging of your cluster and container workloads. You can collect and analyze performance metrics, logs, and Kubernetes events to troubleshoot and optimize your applications.

## DevOps and CI/CD

AKS can be integrated with Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD tools to build and deploy containerized applications. You can use tools like Helm, Kustomize, or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to define and manage your application's infrastructure and configuration.

## Best Practices

- Plan and design your cluster architecture, including node sizes, node pools, and networking options.
- Use namespaces and RBAC to enforce isolation and access control between teams and applications.
- Implement autoscaling for both pods and nodes to optimize resource usage and handle varying workloads.
- Use proper storage options for your application's data persistence requirements.
- Leverage built-in load balancing and ingress solutions for traffic routing and SSL termination.
- Monitor and analyze your cluster and applications using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD tools to automate deployment processes.
- Apply security best practices, such as integrating with Azure Active Directory, using network security groups, and enforcing Azure Policy.
- Regularly update and patch your Kubernetes environment to keep it secure and up-to-date.

Understanding Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will help you deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes on Azure. Make sure to explore the official AKS documentation and related Kubernetes resources to learn more and apply this knowledge in your projects.
