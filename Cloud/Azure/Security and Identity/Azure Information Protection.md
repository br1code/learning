# Azure Information Protection

Azure Information Protection (AIP) is a cloud-based solution that helps organizations classify, label, and protect sensitive information. It enables you to apply persistent protection to documents and emails, control access to data, and track usage. Here's an overview of its key aspects:

## Classification and Labeling

AIP allows you to create custom classification labels based on your organization's data protection requirements. You can define labels manually or use automatic rules based on specific conditions, such as keywords, regular expressions, or data patterns.

## Protection

Once classified and labeled, AIP can apply protection to sensitive data using Azure Rights Management Service (Azure RMS), which is part of AIP. Protection can include encryption, usage restrictions, and access control based on user identity, device, or location.

## Persistent Protection

The protection applied by AIP remains with the data, regardless of where it's stored or with whom it's shared. This ensures sensitive information remains protected even when it's accessed outside your organization's boundaries.

## Monitoring and Reporting

AIP provides monitoring and reporting capabilities to help you track how your sensitive data is being accessed, used, and shared. You can generate detailed reports, monitor user activity, and receive alerts for specific events, such as unauthorized access or data leaks.

## Integration with Microsoft 365

AIP is integrated with Microsoft 365 applications, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, allowing users to classify and protect data directly within these applications. It also supports integration with Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive for Business.

## AIP Client

The AIP client is a software component that can be installed on users' devices, enabling them to classify, label, and protect data on their local machines. It also provides a scanner that can discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored in on-premises file repositories.

## Custom Permissions

You can define custom permissions for your organization, specifying granular access and usage rights for protected data, such as view-only, edit, print, or copy.

## Secure Collaboration

AIP enables secure collaboration by allowing you to share protected data with external partners or users while maintaining control over how it's accessed and used.

## Revocation

AIP allows you to revoke access to protected data at any time, ensuring sensitive information remains secure even if it has been shared inappropriately.

## SDK and REST API

AIP provides a software development kit (SDK) and REST API, enabling developers to integrate data protection capabilities into custom applications or third-party services.
