# Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center is a unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your data centers and provides advanced threat protection across your hybrid workloads in the cloud and on-premises. Here's an overview of its key aspects:

## Continuous Assessment

Security Center continuously assesses the security posture of your Azure resources and provides a Secure Score, which quantifies your current security status. The Secure Score is based on various security controls and recommendations.

## Security Recommendations

Security Center provides recommendations based on Azure best practices and compliance standards to help you improve your security posture. These recommendations may include enabling encryption, configuring network security groups, or applying system updates.

## Compliance Management

Security Center helps you manage and monitor compliance with industry standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. You can view compliance reports and track progress over time.

## Adaptive Application Controls

Security Center uses machine learning to analyze the processes running on your virtual machines and recommends application allowlists to prevent unauthorized software from executing.

## Just-In-Time VM Access

Just-In-Time VM Access reduces the attack surface of your VMs by enabling you to limit the time and source IP addresses that can access management ports (e.g., RDP or SSH).

## Advanced Threat Protection

Security Center's advanced threat protection capabilities can detect and block threats, such as malware, ransomware, or DDoS attacks. It can also identify potential security breaches or suspicious activities by analyzing logs and network traffic.

## Azure Defender

Azure Defender is an integrated threat protection solution that provides enhanced security features for specific Azure services, including Azure Storage, SQL databases, Kubernetes, and Key Vault. It extends Security Center's capabilities to detect advanced threats and provide actionable alerts.

## Integration with Azure Services

Security Center integrates with various Azure services, such as Azure Policy, Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel, and Azure Logic Apps, to provide a comprehensive security management solution.

## Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Support

Security Center can be extended to monitor and manage security across on-premises, multi-cloud, and hybrid environments, providing a unified view of your security posture.

## Monitoring and Alerts

Security Center provides monitoring and alerting capabilities through its dashboard, Azure Monitor, and email notifications. You can use these tools to stay informed about your security status, investigate incidents, and respond to threats.
