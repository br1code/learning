# Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics service that helps you gain insights into the performance, availability, and health of your applications, infrastructure, and network. By collecting, analyzing, and visualizing telemetry data, Azure Monitor enables you to proactively detect and diagnose issues, optimize performance, and make informed decisions about your Azure resources. Here's an overview of Azure Monitor:

## Data Collection

Azure Monitor collects telemetry data from various sources, including Azure resources (such as VMs, App Services, and Storage Accounts), application logs, custom metrics, and platform metrics. Data can be collected through built-in integrations, the Azure Monitor REST API, or by using various SDKs and agents.

## Metrics

Metrics are numerical values that represent the performance, health, and availability of Azure resources. Azure Monitor provides built-in platform metrics for most Azure services, as well as support for custom metrics, which can be used to monitor application-specific data.

## Logs

Azure Monitor collects log data from various sources, such as Azure Activity Logs, Azure Diagnostic Logs, and custom application logs. Logs provide detailed information about the operations, events, and errors that occur within your Azure resources and applications.

## Application Insights

Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service that's part of Azure Monitor. It helps you monitor your live applications, detect and diagnose performance issues, and understand user behavior. Application Insights supports a variety of platforms and languages, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and more.

## Azure Log Analytics

Azure Log Analytics is a powerful log search and analytics service that's part of Azure Monitor. It allows you to analyze log data from various sources, create custom queries and visualizations, and set up alerts based on specific log patterns or anomalies.

## Alerts

Azure Monitor allows you to create alerts based on specific conditions, such as metric thresholds or log patterns. Alerts can notify you via email, SMS, or webhook when an issue is detected, enabling you to take proactive action to resolve the problem.

## Dashboards

Azure Monitor provides customizable dashboards that allow you to visualize and analyze your monitoring data. You can create custom dashboards using various widgets, such as charts, tables, and maps, to display relevant metrics, logs, and alerts for your Azure resources and applications.

## Integration with Other Services

Azure Monitor integrates with various Azure services, such as Azure Security Center, Azure Sentinel, and Azure Automation, allowing you to leverage monitoring data for security, compliance, and automation purposes.

## Diagnostic Settings

Azure Monitor provides diagnostic settings that allow you to configure how telemetry data is collected, stored, and processed. You can route data to different destinations, such as Log Analytics workspaces, Azure Storage Accounts, or Azure Event Hubs, depending on your monitoring and analytics requirements.
