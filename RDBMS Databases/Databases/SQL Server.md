## Examples and syntax

Here's a simple example using SQL Server to create a table, insert rows, query, update, and delete rows. In this example, we'll create a `books` table with columns similar to the MongoDB example.

**Creating a Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    title NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    year_published INT NOT NULL
);
```

**Inserting New Rows:**

```sql
INSERT INTO books (title, author, year_published)
VALUES ('To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee', 1960),
       ('Pride and Prejudice', 'Jane Austen', 1813),
       ('The Catcher in the Rye', 'J.D. Salinger', 1951);
```

**Querying Rows:**

1. Select all books:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books;
```

2. Select books by a specific author:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE author = 'Harper Lee';
```

3. Select books published before a specific year:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE year_published < 2000;
```

**Updating Rows:**

1. Update the title of a specific book:

```sql
UPDATE books
SET title = 'To Kill a Mockingbird (Updated)'
WHERE id = 1;
```

2. Update the author of all books with a specific author:

```sql
UPDATE books
SET author = 'Harper Lee (Updated)'
WHERE author = 'Harper Lee';
```

**Deleting Rows:**

1. Delete a specific book:

```sql
DELETE FROM books WHERE id = 1;
```

2. Delete all books with a specific author:

```sql
DELETE FROM books WHERE author = 'Harper Lee (Updated)';
```

These SQL code snippets provide a simple cheatsheet for creating a table, inserting rows, querying, updating, and deleting rows in SQL Server. Adjust the table schema, filters, and other parameters as needed to match your specific use case.

## Data Modeling

Data modeling in SQL Server involves designing the structure and organization of your data. It is crucial to create effective schemas and optimize data models to make the most of SQL Server's features.
