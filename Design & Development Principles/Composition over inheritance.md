# Composition over inheritance

## Introduction

Composition over inheritance is a design principle in object-oriented programming that encourages the use of object composition (combining simpler objects to build more complex ones) rather than inheritance (creating new objects by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing objects) as the primary mechanism for code reuse and modularity.

## Background

Inheritance has been a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create new classes by extending existing ones, thus promoting code reuse and reducing duplication. However, overusing inheritance can lead to problems such as tight coupling, inflexibility, and increased complexity. The composition over inheritance principle emerged as an alternative approach to address these issues.

## Definition and key concepts

Composition over inheritance suggests that, instead of relying on inheritance to create specialized classes, developers should create more flexible and modular designs by composing objects with other objects that implement the desired behaviors.

Key concepts related to this principle include:

1. Composition: The process of building complex objects by combining simpler ones. Objects delegate responsibility to their constituent components, rather than inheriting behaviors from a superclass.
2. Inheritance: A way to create new classes by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes, which can lead to tight coupling and inflexible designs if overused.
3. Interface: A contract that specifies a set of methods an object must implement, enabling composition by allowing objects to communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces.

## Benefits and Advantages

Using composition over inheritance offers several benefits:

1. Flexibility: Composition allows for more flexible designs, as objects can easily change their behavior at runtime by incorporating different components.
2. Modularity: Composition promotes modularity by encouraging small, focused components that can be combined to create complex behavior.
3. Easier maintenance: Since composition relies on loosely coupled components, it is generally easier to update or replace individual parts without affecting the entire system.
4. Reduced complexity: Inheritance can lead to deep and complex class hierarchies, making code harder to understand and maintain. Composition helps to avoid this by creating simpler, more focused relationships between objects.

## Challenges and Limitations

1. Complexity: Composition can lead to increased complexity, as it requires developers to manage relationships between components and their lifecycles.
2. Performance: In some cases, composition may introduce performance overhead due to the need to delegate calls to composed objects.
3. Learning curve: Adopting a composition-based approach might be a paradigm shift for developers accustomed to inheritance-based designs, increasing the learning curve.

## Best Practices and Guidelines

To effectively apply the composition over inheritance principle, follow these best practices and guidelines:

1. Favor composition: Prefer composition over inheritance when designing new classes or extending existing ones.
2. Encapsulate behavior: Encapsulate the behavior of components, allowing for better separation of concerns and easier maintenance.
3. Use interfaces: Implement interfaces to enforce contracts and facilitate object interactions, making the code more flexible and adaptable.
4. Keep components small and focused: Simple, focused components are easier to understand, reuse, and maintain.
5. Leverage dependency injection: This enables easier testing, swapping of implementations, and decoupling of components.

## Example

Let's consider a simple example in the context of a game where characters can have different abilities:

```csharp
public interface IAbility
{
    void Execute();
}

public class FlyAbility : IAbility
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Flying");
    }
}

public class SwimAbility : IAbility
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Swimming");
    }
}

public class GameCharacter
{
    private readonly IAbility _ability;

    public GameCharacter(IAbility ability)
    {
        _ability = ability;
    }

    public void PerformAbility()
    {
        _ability.Execute();
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        GameCharacter flyingCharacter = new GameCharacter(new FlyAbility());
        GameCharacter swimmingCharacter = new GameCharacter(new SwimAbility());

        flyingCharacter.PerformAbility(); // Output: Flying
        swimmingCharacter.PerformAbility(); // Output: Swimming
    }
}
```

In this example, we use composition to provide different abilities to `GameCharacter` instances by injecting an implementation of the `IAbility` interface. This approach avoids the need for a complex inheritance hierarchy and enables easy swapping of abilities.

Conclusion:

Composition over inheritance is a powerful design principle that promotes flexibility, reusability, and maintainability in software development. By composing simple objects to create more complex ones, developers can avoid the pitfalls of rigid inheritance hierarchies. Although composition can introduce some complexity and performance overhead, following best practices and leveraging interfaces can mitigate these challenges. The example provided demonstrates how composition, when combined with interfaces and dependency injection, can lead to a more adaptable and maintainable codebase in C# and .NET applications.
